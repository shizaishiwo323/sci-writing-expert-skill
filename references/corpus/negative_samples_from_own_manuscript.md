# Negative Samples from Own Manuscript

This file stores negative and caution examples from `raw_modification_log.md`. It is used to prevent the sentence-polishing skill from learning unsafe behaviors from the author's manuscript revision history.

It does not provide paragraph-level rewriting rules. It does not teach the skill to add mechanisms, citations, claims, or manuscript logic.

## Label System

- `overclaim`: claim strength is too high.
- `vague_subject`: subject is generic or template-like.
- `decorative_verb`: verb sounds ornate rather than precise.
- `template_phrase`: repeated phrase such as `giving rise to`.
- `redundant_wording`: unnecessary degree words or repeated phrasing.
- `invented_compound`: newly coined compound term.
- `undefined_term`: central term is introduced without a safe definition.
- `heavy_nominalization`: noun chain hides the action.
- `stage_unclear`: temporal or stage relation is unclear.
- `clarify_causal_link`: causal or process relation is under-specified.
- `standard_term`: wording should follow common academic or disciplinary usage.
- `latex_risk`: LaTeX, variables, citations, labels, or units must be protected.
- `typo_or_intermediate_draft`: teacher/intermediate version contains spelling, spacing, or grammar errors.
- `out_of_scope_rewrite`: revision changes title, storyline, paragraph function, evidence chain, mechanism, literature bridge, or technical definition.
- `partial_learning_only`: only one local pattern can be learned.
- `author_confirm_required`: safe revision requires author confirmation.

## Usage Rule

Each sample below has a `Must not learn` field. That field is the most important part of this file.

Do not import these samples directly into `SKILL.md`. Use them first as a guardrail corpus when testing whether sentence polishing stays local and conservative.

## Expression-Level Local Samples

## NEG-001: Temporal sequence needs a light connector

Sample type: safe-local-example  
Auto-fix status: allowed  
Source ID: A-005  
Original:
Face dissolution evolves from a single peak to separated peaks and back to one peak as coupling weakens and the matrix is consumed.

Safe local correction:
Face dissolution evolves from a single peak to separated peaks, then back to one peak as coupling weakens and the matrix is consumed.

Problem labels: `stage_unclear`, `template_phrase`  
May learn: Use a light connector to clarify sequence.  
Must not learn: Do not add a new stage, mechanism, or process endpoint.  
Scope: sentence-level.

## NEG-002: Diagnostic claim too strong

Sample type: safe-local-example  
Auto-fix status: cautious  
Source ID: A-009  
Original:
Supported by flow-field tortuosity, this physics-based interpretation establishes NMR $T_2$ evolution as a quantitative diagnostic of dissolution mechanisms.

Safe local correction:

## NEG-003: Repeated regime description is overloaded

Sample type: safe-local-example  
Auto-fix status: cautious  
Source ID: I-003  
Original:
When the reaction is much slower than transport, the reactant penetrates approximately throughout the entire domain, leading to uniform dissolution of the pore structure \cite{rroded_2020_reactive}. When transport is significantly slower than reaction, the dissolution pattern manifests as face dissolution, which is confined to the inlet pores, giving rise to a distinct progressing front \cite{cohen_2008_from}. As injection rates increase, advection and reaction dominate over diffusion. Consequently, reactive-infiltration instabilities emerge, giving rise to wormholes \cite{fredd_1998_influence,Wang_2022}. In the channeling regime, preferential flow paths rapidly widen along their entire trajectory \cite{menke_2016_reservoir}.

Safe local correction:
When reaction is much slower than transport, the reactants penetrate the entire domain, leading to uniform dissolution \cite{rroded_2020_reactive}. When transport is significantly slower than reaction, dissolution localizes near the inlet as a progressing face-dissolution front \cite{cohen_2008_from}. At higher injection rates, reactive-infiltration instabilities focus flow and form wormholes \cite{fredd_1998_influence,Wang_2022}, whereas the channeling regime rapidly expands preferential flow paths along their entire trajectory \cite{menke_2016_reservoir}.
