# Source Sentence Corpus

This file stores sentence-level records from seven high-quality papers. Each record gives the paper, section, function, reusable pattern, reason, risk, and instruction. Full source sentences are omitted because this repository is public; consult the original paper through its record ID when the wording is needed.

## Use Status Legend

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `positive` | Good source for a preferred expression pattern |
| `caution` | Useful local feature, but not safe to imitate directly because of strong wording, long syntax, or other risks |
| `negative` | Counterexample or test-only sentence |

Load this file only to look up records by function tag or paper ID. For routine editing, `corpus_rule_cards.md` is enough.

## P01-S01

**Section:** Introduction  
**Function tag:** DEF  
**Score:** 9/10  
**Use status:** positive

**Local context:** Introduces the named relation before discussing its exponent.  
**Why it works:** The definition is short and immediately tied to the variables the reader needs.  
**Transferable rule:** Define a named law, metric, or framework at first use with a plain clause.  
**Reusable pattern:** `This relation, known as X, relates A to B through C.`  
**Risk when misused:** The pattern becomes heavy if every common term is over-defined.

**Section:** Introduction  
**Function tag:** GAP  
**Score:** 8/10  
**Use status:** positive

**Local context:** States why the existing empirical relation still needs explanation.  
**Why it works:** The gap is a specific missing basis, not a vague claim that little is known.  
**Transferable rule:** Connect a gap to a concrete missing mechanism, measurement, scale, or geometry.  
**Reusable pattern:** `A physical understanding of X remains limited because Y is not well constrained.`
