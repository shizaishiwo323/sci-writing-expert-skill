# Extraction Protocol

Public-repository rule: store the extracted rule, pattern, function tag, and source pointer. Do not commit full source sentences or paper text, even when a working note below mentions a source sentence.

This file defines how to extract sentence-level examples from the seven reference papers. The corpus is used to derive polishing rules, not to copy source sentences or imitate a paper's scientific argument.

## Scope

The extraction only supports sentence-level academic polishing:

- improve clarity, concision, and evidence control;
- preserve scientific meaning, citations, variables, figure labels, equations, and paragraph order;
- avoid unsupported mechanisms, new claims, broader implications, or changes to the paper storyline.

When a sentence contains a scientific judgment that cannot be verified from the local text, mark it as `author-confirm` rather than rewriting the judgment.

P05 and P08 are the two exemplar papers (E2 and E1 in `exemplar_niu_zhang.md`). P01 to P07 have ten records each in `source_sentence_corpus.md`. The fuller exemplar pass for P08 and P05 (chains `Pxx-Cnn`, and P05 sentence records from S11) is in `exemplar_niu_zhang_records.md`.

## Extraction Target

For the first complete corpus pass:

- extract 10 sentence records per paper;
- keep all seven papers represented;
- cover Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion/Conclusion where possible;
- tag every record by writing function;
- convert every selected sentence into a reusable polishing rule.

The corpus can later be expanded to 12-15 records per paper after the rule cards are tested on the user's own manuscript sentences.

## Function Tags

| Tag | Meaning | What the skill should learn |
|---|---|---|
| `DEF` | Defines a term, variable, metric, or concept | Introduce specialized terms without making readers guess |
| `GAP` | States a research gap | Name a specific unresolved relation, mechanism, metric, or condition |
| `AIM` | States the study aim or contribution | Say what the paper does without promotional language |
| `MET` | Describes method, model, data, or workflow | Keep method sentences concrete and bounded |
| `ASS` | States an assumption or simplification | Explain scope without defensiveness |
| `RES` | Reports results | Put observation, direction, comparison, and numbers before interpretation |
| `CON` | Compares cases, mechanisms, or prior work | Use contrast to clarify, not to exaggerate |
| `IMP` | Interprets mechanism, implication, limitation, or future use | Keep interpretation tied to evidence and conditions |
| `BKG` | Opens a paper or supplies background the reader needs | Start from use or control, and narrow one step per sentence |
| `LNK` | Links sentences, paragraphs, or sections | Begin with the known, end with the new, and mark the relation plainly |
| `MAP` | States a road map or the job of a section | Promise the order, then keep it |
| `CLO` | Summarizes in an abstract or Conclusions | Replay the paper in its own order without new claims |
| `STY` | Records surface forms to correct | Learn the function, not the slip |

The last five tags were added for the exemplar pass. A record may carry two tags joined by `+`.

## Use Status

Every source record must include a `Use status` field so the skill does not treat all source sentences as positive templates.

| Status | Meaning | How to use it |
|---|---|---|
| `positive` | The sentence is a good expression model | Use it as a source for preferred patterns |
| `caution` | The sentence has a useful local feature but also has risks such as strong words, long conditions, or awkward syntax | Extract the rule, but do not copy the surface form directly |
| `negative` | The sentence is useful only as a counterexample or test case | Use it for checking what the skill should avoid |

Mark as `caution` when the sentence contains high-risk expressions such as `solely`, `no study`, `universal`, `demonstrates`, `ensures`, `profound`, or `sharply`, or when the sentence is too long to be used as a direct template.

## Scoring

Each candidate sentence is scored out of 10. Keep records scoring 7 or above.

| Criterion | Score | Question |
|---|---:|---|
| Clarity | 0-2 | Are the subject, verb, and object easy to identify? |
| Concision | 0-2 | Does the sentence avoid loose intensifiers, empty nouns, and unnecessary complexity? |
| Transferability | 0-2 | Can this sentence be converted into a reusable polishing instruction? |
| Evidence control | 0-2 | Does the sentence avoid overstating the evidence? |
| Section value | 0-2 | Is it representative of a common sentence function in that section? |

## Keep / Reject Rules

Keep sentences that:

- define a technical term at first use;
- state a concrete gap without attacking prior work;
- report a result before interpreting it;
- use a bounded claim such as `suggests`, `is consistent with`, or `under these conditions`;
- explain a method or assumption without adding results;
- show how to compare cases cleanly.

Reject sentences that:

- are good mainly because of paper logic rather than sentence expression;
- rely on long lists of citations and cannot be reused as a writing pattern;
- use fancy terms without local definition;
- contain broad claims such as `opens a new avenue` or `fundamentally changes` without strong support;
- are too context-specific to become a polishing rule.

## Record Template

Use a block record rather than a large table.

```markdown
## Pxx-Sxx

**Section:** Introduction / Methods / Results / Discussion / Conclusion  
**Function tag:** DEF / GAP / AIM / MET / ASS / RES / CON / IMP  
**Score:** 7-10/10  
**Use status:** positive / caution / negative

**Source sentence:**  
> One selected sentence.

**Local context:**  
What this sentence does in its paragraph.

**Why it works:**  
Why it is effective at the sentence-expression level.

**Transferable rule:**  
The reusable writing rule.

**Reusable pattern:**  
`A compact pattern that can guide polishing.`

**Risk when misused:**  
How the pattern could become overstated, vague, or AI-like.

**Skill-ready instruction:**  
An instruction that can be copied into the polishing skill.
```

## Extraction Workflow

1. Build a broad candidate pool from each PDF.
   - Verify: each paper has Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion/Conclusion candidates when available.

2. Score and keep at least 10 records per paper.
   - Verify: every retained sentence scores 7 or above and has a function tag.

3. Convert each sentence into a rule-oriented record.
   - Verify: every record contains `Use status`, `Transferable rule`, `Risk when misused`, and `Skill-ready instruction`.

4. Consolidate rules by function tag into `corpus_rule_cards.md`.
   - Verify: each tag has multiple rule cards, at least one preferred pattern, and `Derived from` source mapping.

## Rule-Card Traceability

Every rule card in `corpus_rule_cards.md` must include:

```markdown
**Derived from:** Pxx-Sxx, Pxx-Sxx
```

This prevents rule drift during future iterations. If a rule cannot be traced to the corpus, the user's known problem list, or an explicit academic-writing principle, do not add it.

## Quality Control

After each extraction pass, check:

- all 7 papers are represented;
- total records are between 70 and 105;
- no record is just a copied sentence without analysis;
- every record supports sentence polishing rather than scientific argument revision;
- every record can help decide whether to define a term, remove a fancy phrase, reduce overclaim, simplify syntax, or preserve evidence strength;
- no rule encourages adding mechanisms, new interpretations, or broader claims;
- high-risk positive examples are marked `caution` rather than treated as direct style templates.

## Exemplar Pass

The exemplar pass reads a whole paper that the skill author has chosen as a writing model, and records how its sentences follow one another as well as how single sentences are built. It was first applied to P08 and P05.

Rules that differ from the first pass:

- No fixed number of records. Cover every main section, and keep a record only if it scores 7 or above.
- Use two record types. A chain record (`Pxx-Cnn`) covers a paragraph or a run of sentences. A sentence record (`Pxx-Snn`) covers one sentence or an adjacent pair.
- Replace `Source sentence` with `Source pointer` (page, section, paragraph, sentence). Never store the sentence.
- Add `Sentence link` to say how the sentence is tied to the one before or after it: which earlier words it picks up, and which connector it uses.
- In a chain record, add `Sentence-by-sentence moves`: one numbered line per sentence saying what that sentence does. Quote only the connector or opening frame, in backticks.
- If the skill author marked the passage in their copy, add `Reader mark` with a short description of the mark. Record marks about writing function only. Leave out the reader's private research notes.
- Record non-native grammar and inflated wording as `caution`, give the corrected form in `Risk when misused`, and collect the forms in one `STY` record per paper.
- Before committing, check the records against the extracted paper text for shared word sequences. Sequences of eight or more words should be limited to stock frames such as an objective or scope opener.

Chain record template:

```markdown
## Pxx-Cnn

**Source pointer:** p. N, section, paragraph, sentences a-b
**Section:** ...
**Function tag:** LNK + ...
**Score:** 7-10/10
**Use status:** positive / caution
**Reader mark:** optional

**Local context:** What the paragraph does in its section.
**Sentence-by-sentence moves:**
1. What sentence 1 does.
2. What sentence 2 does.

**Why it works:** ...
**Sentence link:** How each sentence picks up the previous one.
**Transferable rule:** ...
**Reusable pattern:** `A multi-sentence pattern with placeholders.`
**Risk when misused:** ...
**Skill-ready instruction:** ...
```

Rule cards derived from exemplar records may address sentence order within a paragraph and the arrangement of paragraphs and sections. They keep the `Derived from` line and the ban on new facts, mechanisms, citations, and claims.
